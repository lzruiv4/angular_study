You only need to give the following command in the terminal to deploy the backend with springboot.

```bash
npm run setup-backend
```

#### New Start the backend

After the initial deployment, you can simply enter the following command in the terminal to quickly start the container next time.

docker build -t my-angular-app .
# run the container
docker run -d -p 4200:80 my-angular-app
```
